Ok, fine, let's do it!!!!
It's totally worth the risk...

Let's check on Taylor... 😰

Phew! Everything is looking good. She's still the same Taylor, age 25 and all...
Time to check on yourself... 😰

you

/*:
Looks like it's all good captain! We've fixed the horrible time travel bug! 😅
*/

/*:
**Summary**: Value Types are copied every time they're passed to a function or mutated. When you're modifying a value type, you're modifying a copy of it, never the original... so your original value is always safe!

When working in Swift, prefer value types over reference types!
