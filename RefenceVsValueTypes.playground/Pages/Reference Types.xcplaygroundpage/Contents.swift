😱
So something went horribly wrong... We've accidently aged today's Taylor Swift...
What about you?!!!

you

You've accidently aged your current self!!!!

**Summary**: Reference Types point to a an object in memory. When you're modifying a reference type, you're modifying the original copy... so you have to be careful... something could go terribly wrong
