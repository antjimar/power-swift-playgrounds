# Level Up on Value Types
In this tutorial, we're going to have a simple example of a todo list to keep exploring the concept of immutability of value types and how to work with them

Here is our TodoItem struct. It's pretty straight-forward. The only difference is that it is a value type.

    // This is the description of the task that needs to be done
    let description: String

    // Keeping track of whether the todo item is completed or not
    // Note that when this item is set to complete, a brand new todo item copy gets created with the different complete value
    var completed: Bool

/*:
We need an array to keep track of all the todo items. 
Note that this array needs to be a variable - every time a todo item inside of it gets changed, it gets re-assigned to a whole new copy of the this array!

/*:
To complete to a todo item, we need to create a new copy of the todo item, with the opposite value for the completed property. 
Note the functional aspect of this function. A value is placed in, tranformed, and a new one is returned with no unwanted side effects (such as mutating the original todoItem). This would be really easy to test.
