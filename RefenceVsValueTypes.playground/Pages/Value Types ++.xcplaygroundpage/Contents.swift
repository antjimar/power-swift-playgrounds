We need an array to keep track of all the todo items. 
Note that this array needs to be a variable - every time a todo item inside of it gets changed, it gets re-assigned to a whole new copy of the this array!

To complete to a todo item, we need to create a new copy of the todo item, with the opposite value for the completed property. 
Note the functional aspect of this function. A value is placed in, tranformed, and a new one is returned with no unwanted side effects (such as mutating the original todoItem). This would be really easy to test.
